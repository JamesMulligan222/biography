<p>That's me. I truly am a nobody. My life has been one of fear and anxiety. I am 28 years old and I have achieved nothing. But my life story isn't over. I would like to tell you a little bit about myself</p>

<h2>My Parents</h2>
Both of my parents come from middle class South Dublin families. My dad was the middle child and the only boy and my mom was the oldest of three girls. My dad went to the local public school from primary school until the end of secondary school and my mom went to a private shool. Both of them had relatively hard upbringings. My dad;s dad left my grandmother and my dad and aunts when my dad was two. My grandfather embezzled millions of pounds from his company and left to the Bahamas with his new wife, my father's babysitter. There he had another child with his mistress and would eventually move to Spain where he died a few years ago. I never met him but I sometimes wonder how the genes I share with him influence my behaviour. My grandmother on my father's side was forced to raise three children completely on her own. Eventually she would meet a very intelligent and charming man who became my step grandfather and they remain together to this day. Unfortunately, as I write this my grandmother is terminally ill. No matter how much time you have with someone you love it is never enough. I don't know what my dad studied in university but he ended up working for Vodafone. The corporate environment did not suit him. He had an alcohol problem when he was young but he no longer drinks. I too would develop an alcohol problem around the age of 18 but now I am completely sober and have been for nearly 8 months as I write this. As you will see, I had more than an alcohol problem. I was on some pretty heavy drugs. My mom was raised in a slightly more affluent environment. Her mom was a physiotherapist and I don't remember exactly what her father did. My grandfather on my mother's side was apparently an alcoholic and was irresponsible with the family money. My mom once told me how her mother came into her bedroom one night to tell her that her husband had spent all their money. This caused great anxiety in my mother and I can't help wonder that her anxiety was passed onto me genetically. I do have a very severe anxiety disorder and am diagnosed with schizophrenia. That all comes later though. My mom says she was friendless in school and had severe anxiety. My father likely has anxiety too but he would never admit it. Both of my mom's parents would die before I was born. One of my mom's sisters would go on to develop schizophrenia also, so I must have been genetically susceptible to it. She tragically died in April of 2015. They do say schizophrenics have a shorter lifespan. My mom and dad would have socialised in the same circles, my dad often throwing parties in my grandmother's house while she and her partner were on holiday. I don't know much about their relationship before me but they were never a couple as far as I know. Whatever led up to it, I was conceived and born in 1995. They were both 23 and thankfully abortion wasn't available in Ireland at that time. To put my birth into perspective,  was the first child born out of any of my mom or dad's friend circle. They were both middle class, educated young people so my conception was a bit of a shock. I would also be the first grandchild of either side of the family.
